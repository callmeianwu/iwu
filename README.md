## 🕹️ What is IWU?

IWU is a programming language that thinks different™. It combines the vintage charm of Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) with modern programming patterns. Think of it as if a 1970s calculator had a love child with Python! 

```
     📟 RPN + 🚀 Modern Features = 💫 IWU
```

## ✨ Features That Make IWU Awesome

### 🧮 Classic RPN Calculations
```ruby
3 4 + 2 *    # Old school cool! Result: 14
```

### 🎯 Dead-Simple Variable Declaration
```ruby
i x = 4      # 'i' for initialize, because we're fancy
```

### 🛠️ Built-in Swiss Army Knife Functions
```ruby
sum 1 2 3 4  # Adds numbers like it's nobody's business
max 10 20 5  # Finds the champion
min 5 8 2    # Discovers the underdog
```

### 📢 Print When You Need It
```ruby
pl "Look ma, I'm coding!"  # Prints a line
pr x                       # Shows the result
pl pr x                    # Does both because why not?
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📥 Installation

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iwu.git

# Build like it's 1999
g++ iwu.cpp -o iwu

# Run it like you mean it
./iwu your_awesome_code.txt
```

### 🎮 Your First IWU Program

```ruby
# saved as "hello_world.txt"
i message = "Hello, World!"
pl pr message
```

## 📖 Documentation

### The IWU Cheatsheet

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| `i` | Variable declaration | `i x = 42` |
| `pl` | Print line | `pl "Wassup!"` |
| `pr` | Print result | `pr x` |
| `sum` | Add numbers | `sum 1 2 3` |
| `max` | Find maximum | `max 42 73` |
| `min` | Find minimum | `min 7 11` |

## 🌟 Examples

### Calculator Mode
```ruby
5 2 / 6 -         # Division and subtraction
i result = 10 2 * # Store multiplication result
```

### Variable Magic
```ruby
i x = 5
i y = 4
y = sum x y       # y now holds their sum
pl pr y           # Show me the money!
```

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork it (because sharing is caring)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some awesomeness'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/awesome-feature`)
5. Create a Pull Request (and wait for internet high-fives)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Function names are sacred (no `i sum = 4`)
- Strictly RPN for calculations (just like grandpa used to write)
- Must use 'i' for variable declarations (we're not animals)
