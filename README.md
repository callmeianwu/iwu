 > To do basic calculations, use Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
 > To declare a variable, start the line with "i". EX: i x = 4 
 > Functions: To make a calculation that has been preset, use "sum", "max", "min". EX: x = sum 5 4
 > To print a line, use "pl", to print the result, use "pr". EX: pl pr x = sum 5 4 -> This will print out: x = sum 5 4 -> 9


To use the code, compile iwu.cpp and then run it by using compile name, then the name you want to calculate. EX: ./iwu test.txt
